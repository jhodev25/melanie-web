      <h1>ABOUT</h1>
      <h3>
        From my earliest days, I embraced the label of an introvert. However, as life unfolded, I discovered that
        pushing my boundaries and embracing independence could be a thrilling adventure. It was in moments of
        vulnerability and openness that I truly connected with others and grew.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        My journey took me far from my hometown to embark on a college adventure in a different state, and later, I
        crossed oceans for a transformative study abroad experience. These calculated risks not only expanded my
        horizons but also helped me build confidence and adaptability.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        In Portland, I delved into the worlds of marketing and fine arts, gaining valuable experience in both non-profit
        and luxury automotive sectors. Collaborating with numerous vendors and creative partners, I developed a deep
        passion for curating and coordinating unforgettable experiences.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Now, I've returned to my roots in San Francisco, in search of opportunities that resonate with my sense of home
        and belonging. I'm thrilled to join an industry where I can wholeheartedly dedicate myself to creating
        exceptional shared experiences between brands and communities.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        In essence, my goal is to gather professional and personal experiences that fill my life with gratitude and joy.
        I find immense value in the relationships I form and the communities that teach me about myself, as I continue
        to explore and grow in this vast world.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        In my free time, you can find me taking the streetcar to my favorite corners of San Francisco, walking through
        the lawns of Golden Gate Park, taking a light jog to Ocean Beach, or volunteering at the Asian Art Museum.
